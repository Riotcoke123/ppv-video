MySQL Databases
Replace 'your_mysql_host', 'your_mysql_username', and 'your_mysql_password' with your MySQL database connection details. 


Replace 'YOUR_PAYPAL_EMAIL', 'YOUR_IPN_HANDLER_URL', 'YOUR_SUCCESS_URL', and 'YOUR_CANCEL_URL' with your actual PayPal email, IPN handler URL, success page URL, and cancel page URL.


Implementing the IPN handler involves validating the IPN request, processing the IPN data, updating the order status in your database, and handling additional actions based on the payment status.

Please refer to the PayPal IPN documentation for more details on how to implement the IPN handler: PayPal IPN Documentation.

Make sure to secure your IPN handler and validate the IPN messages to prevent fraudulent activities. Additionally, test your PayPal integration in the sandbox environment before deploying it to production.
